/**
 * Put a program into a Cloudflare Workers playground URL.
 *
 * The playground keeps whatever it is showing in the URL **fragment** — the
 * `#…` part, which a browser never sends to a server. So a link generated here
 * carries the program *and* the API key baked into it without either reaching
 * Cloudflare on page load. That is what lets the setup page hand somebody a
 * single link instead of a copy button and a paste into a code editor, which is
 * the one step that is genuinely bad on a phone.
 *
 * ## The format
 *
 * Undocumented, and read off a real playground link rather than guessed:
 *
 *     #<lz-string compressToEncodedURIComponent of>
 *         "multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary<16 random>"
 *         ":"
 *         <that multipart body>
 *
 * The body is the same shape as Cloudflare's Workers upload API: one part per
 * module, then a `metadata` part naming `main_module`. `worker/tests/parity/`
 * has the captured link this was derived from, and the test suite regenerates it
 * byte for byte from its own parts — which is the only reason to trust any of
 * this, since the format can change whenever Cloudflare likes.
 *
 * **The setup page inlines this file**, so it is written to run unchanged in a
 * browser and in Node: no imports, no Node globals, nothing but `crypto` for the
 * boundary.
