# VERSION: 1.0
# AUTHORS: Unified Torrent Search Interface contributors
#
# A qBittorrent search plugin that sends your searches to your own search URL.
#
# Two lines to fill in, below. The setup page hands you this file with both
# already filled in, so you usually never edit it:
#
#     https://momzv2022-ctrl.github.io/unified-torrent-search-interface/
#
# What it does: one request per search, to your URL, with your key in the
# X-API-Key header. The answer is printed in the format qBittorrent expects.
# Nothing else is contacted, and nothing outside the Python standard library
# is used.
#
# MIT licence. Source and documentation:
#     https://github.com/momzv2022-ctrl/unified-torrent-search-interface
